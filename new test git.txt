New file to check if git captures the change in this folder and then adding it to staging/index area and pushing it to github,
after that check it on git hub if the changes are reflecting 
It worked and now this is second time changes are being done.
so now I will check if I can send this to github and how git hub keeps the track.

Adding this line in feature branch, let see what happens, Intrestingly this is not reflected when branch is switched to main 
will need to merge this to reflect these changes.
